# Dice Roller App

This is a simple React Native application that simulates the rolling of a dice. When the user taps the "Roll Dice" button, the app generates a random number between 1 and 6, and updates the displayed dice image accordingly. Additionally, the app provides haptic feedback to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- Tap-to-roll functionality
- Displays different dice images for values between 1 and 6
- Haptic feedback on dice roll
- Smooth, responsive user interface

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or above)
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android emulation)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any code editor of your choice
- [React Native Haptic Feedback](https://github.com/mkuczera/react-native-haptic-feedback) library for haptic feedback

To install the necessary libraries for this project, run:

```bash
npm install

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
